🧾 LCD Inventory System
<p align="center"> <img src="InventorySystem_GIF.gif" alt="Inventory System Demo" width="700"> </p>
A lightweight desktop application for managing Lenovo parts rotation at work.
Built as a personal project to streamline inventory tracking — think of it as a smarter sheet of paper.

✨ Features
Add entries by Work Order number, Serial Number, Status, and Notes

Update status quickly via dropdown and update button

Automatically logs entries to lcd_log.csv

Manual export option for backup

Supports importing previously exported logs

Edits to CSVs reflected in-app via the Refresh Log button

Parse text from Lenovo directly to auto populate fields for ease of use from clipboard

📦 How to Use
Download the latest release (v1.5)

Extract the files from the ZIP

Run LCD1.5.exe
(Note: Windows may show a security warning — click More Info > Run Anyway)

If lcd_log.csv doesn’t open automatically:

Click Import

Select lcd_log.csv (your current log) or Example.csv to test

💡 Notes
All CSV files (Example.csv, lcd_log.csv) contain dummy data for demonstration purposes only

The app writes changes directly to the CSV, so data is saved in real time

While automatic logging is built-in, it’s still smart to manually export backups now and then

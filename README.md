# Inventory_System_TL
Inventory system for Lenovo parts rotation at my job. 


This is just a personal project for helping me manage some inventory at work. I am a mediocre coder and this program is essentially just a fancy sheet of paper. 

Entries can be added by entering a work order number, serial number, status, and notes. 
Status for each work order can be edited by selecting the entry, choosing a status from the drop down, and selecting update status. 

Program should automatically backup data because it writes to a CSV but I personally backup to a spare CSV manually using the export function.

The refresh log button is outdated but I left it in as if you manually edit the CSV and then hit refresh log the program will reflect those changes.

Enjoy my fancy sheet of paper!
